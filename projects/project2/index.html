		<h1>Where I fell short</h1>
			
		<h2>Idea: Get a world clocks page going</h2>	
		<ul>
			<li>Default clock would be set to the users time zone</li>
			<li>Then they would have the option to view other time zones</li>
			<li>Based on their choice, I would dynamically create a new clock for them</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Downhill</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Took way longer than anticpated to get the clock to function as desired</li>
			<li>Couldn't change time zones</li>
			<li>Clock wasn't embedding correctly into an HTML document.</li>
		</ul>		
		
		<h2>What I have to show</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>An unfinished clock, that seems to be functional</li>
			<li>Broken spirit in drawing again</li>
		</ul>
